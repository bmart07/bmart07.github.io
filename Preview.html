<div class="body"><h3>1</h3>

  <p class="p1">Juliet Morse ran down the hall. She didn&#8217;t need to check her watch to know she would be late again. She knew these halls like the back of her hand, the unchanging landscape of her entire life. The green painted cinderblock walls blurred in her periphery as the tired fluorescent lights lining the ceiling flickered, threatening to go out for once and for all.</p>

  <p class="p1">This is where Juliet and everyone she&#8217;d ever known lived. The residents called it Refuge.</p>

  <p class="p1">She was in her first year of work after general education and still learning how to do her new job. Just last year, Juliet would have gotten off with just a warning or maybe a detention if she had been late for class. But being late for work? She would for sure get a credit cut and a notice. She had already been late to work twice and with two strikes on her record, the third would definitely lead to stiffer consequences. Three strikes and you&#8217;re out. Baseball metaphor, not that she&#8217;d ever played baseball.</p>

  <p class="p1">She didn&#8217;t even remember getting out of bed and turning off the shrill ringing of the alarm on her micro tab. She must have, because the alarm was off when she finally did get out of bed, forty-two minutes later. In her rush to get out the door, she didn&#8217;t even take time to shower or brush her teeth.</p>

  <p class="p1">Suddenly, the ringing that should have woken her earlier this morning sounded all around her. <i>RING RING RING RING</i>. Red strobe lights flashed down the hall, promising to keep it illuminated even if the fluorescent lights died. Avery Graves was taking notes on his micro tab while walking down the hall toward Juliet when the alarm broke his attention. His pale blue eyes glanced at the flashing red lights. He remained calm like the alarm was gently tapping him on the shoulder and not actually screaming at the top of its lungs. Juliet stood frozen in fear, her brown eyes fixed on the flashing lights.</p>

  <p class="p1">Next came the pre-recorded voice. &#8220;Warning. Warning. Everyone, please proceed to the closest safety destination. Warning. Warning.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">Bomb shelters like Refuge were built to be immensely strong and withstand a variety of potential disasters, but there was always the possibility of a fire. She had lost her father in the last fire, and even though that was nine years ago, the memory suddenly felt fresh and raw.</p>

  <p class="p1">Avery had also stopped walking and moved his curious glance from the flashing lights to Juliet. She remained frozen in place, pale and panicked. Her straight brown hair trembled along with the rest of her body. &#8220;Juliet,&#8221; he called to her. &#8220;Juliet.&#8221; She looked over at Avery, not actually seeing him, she was so overwhelmed by the alarm.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Come with me. There is a safe destination near here,&#8221; he said. Juliet grabbed his arm with both of her hands and clutched tightly. He walked slowly, carefully leading her down the hall before turning right. &#8220;Come on, Juliet, just up here,&#8221; he said, reassuring her.</p>

  <p class="p1">This hall wasn&#8217;t marked as a safe destination. It leads nowhere, and simply stretched to the extreme edge of their existence. Everyone called the long narrow hallway on the outskirts &#8220;the pipe&#8221;, and this was the place where teenagers and young adults would hang out away from the prying eyes of the older residents. Halfway down the hall, there were no more lights, and the handrails along the sides of the passage were required to navigate to the end. Avery followed the handrail with his hand while Juliet clung closely to his side. As they continued forward, the hall got darker and darker. The red flashing and noisy alarm also seemed to fade away. Another hundred feet and the alarm was just above a whisper and there was little if any light.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Let&#8217;s sit down here and wait for the all clear. Can you do that with me, Juliet?&#8221; Avery asked. She gave a little nod and even though she knew he couldn&#8217;t see her face in the low light. He slowly lowered himself to the floor, sitting with his back against the wall. Juliet followed, still holding tightly to his arm. She laid her head against his chest and let the stream of tears building up behind her eyes run down her face. All he could do was stroke her brown hair with his hand, and make a soft shushing sound like the ones made for a baby.</p>

  <p class="p1">In the darkness, Juliet&#8217;s imagination could fill her vision, playing her memory of the last fatal fire. Young Juliet thought the alarm was so fun because she got to leave her classroom in the middle of the day. But after they got the all clear, and the children had filed back into their classroom to resume their studies, they were interrupted. An officer from command had knocked on her classroom door. He wore a somber expression over his pressed white shirt which was neatly tucked into his pressed khaki slacks. Only the people working in command wore ties, and his tie was held down neatly with a tack. The serious tone of his close matched the stony expression on his face. He informed her class that this had not been a practice drill. There had been a real fire in the cafeteria kitchen. Juliet&#8217;s stomach clenched. Her head started to feel dizzy. Her father worked in the kitchen.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I need to speak to Juliet Morse,&#8221; the officer said.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;No, no, no, no,&#8221; Juliet thought. The officer led her outside of the classroom into the green painted hall to talk to her one on one. He crouched down to Juliet&#8217;s eye level. She could read his badge, Perry, and smell the coffee on his breath. He told her that John Morse, her father had tried to put out the fire. It was started accidentally by one of the newer cooks, and John got too close to the flame. He sustained burns over most of his body and was being treated in the medical wing. He wouldn&#8217;t make it. Officer Perry had come to take Juliet to the medical wing, so she could say goodbye to her father.</p>

  <p class="p1">She didn&#8217;t want to see her father. Her mother sat in a chair next to the gurney crying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t leave me John. Don&#8217;t leave me.&#8221; Seeing her mom like that was hard enough. Her mother had her hands clasped in prayer, head down, and tears free falling onto the side of the pillow that supported her father&#8217;s head. She didn&#8217;t see her father on that gurney, but rather a blackened man, a shadow. It wasn&#8217;t her father on that gurney, just a shadow. There was nothing for Juliet to do here. Her father was already gone.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; the nurse said to the grieving widow and the little girl who still hadn&#8217;t walked past the door into the room.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;It&#8217;s not my father,&#8221; Juliet said to herself, sitting on the cold floor of the pipe. &#8220;It&#8217;s just his shadow. It&#8217;s just a shadow.&#8221; And what Juliet could see right now, here in the long passage of almost complete darkness, was that shadow.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;All clear.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t the pre-recorded voice Juliet had expected, but Avery talking to Juliet, &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s get up.&#8221; She hadn&#8217;t noticed the alarm stopping or the all-clear signal that followed. She pulled herself up, wiping her face quickly with her hands, hoping to hide the evidence that she might have broken down crying during a simple fire drill. She was suddenly thankful for the almost total darkness and that Avery couldn&#8217;t see her face.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;You okay?&#8221; he asked.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;m fine. I&#8217;ve got it from here.&#8221; She already found the handrail with her hand and took a few tentative steps towards the main hall that would lead her to her work at the conservatory.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Okay. Well, back to work for me.&#8221; They walked together to the main hall, and Avery turned left to continue towards the command center. He stopped a second and looked back, glancing at Juliet. &#8220;You sure you&#8217;ll be okay? I can walk with you if you&#8217;d like.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;No,&#8221; she insisted, &#8220;the conservatory is just right up here. I can get there myself.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;All right.&#8221; He turned and continued walking, his attention already back to reading his micro tab where he left off before the alarm. Juliet watched him walk away, his neatly combed black hair disappearing from sight.</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet turned to the next passage. She wasn&#8217;t going to the conservatory anymore. She&#8217;d go to the medical wing, just to the nurses&#8217; station. They would give her a note to miss work. Going back to bed seemed like a good idea after the morning she had.</p>

  <p class="sb">&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

  <p class="p1">The note got Juliet off of work for the morning. She even stayed in her dorm missing lunch, and the cloud of anxiety had lifted making her feel like herself again. She stowed her micro tab in her desk before leaving her dorm to head over to the conservatory for the second half of her shift. The dorms, which accommodated all the unmarried adults, were pretty empty during the day while most residents were at work.</p>

  <p class="p1">She walked down the hall out of the residential wing and passed through the double doorway leading to the main hallway, following it until she reached the conservatory door to the right. She loved the conservatory because it had light, lots of it. The special lamps lining the ceiling of the large room emitted light that was supposed to mimic the full spectrum from the sun. This was the closest to being outdoors Juliet expected to get in her life. She knew there wasn&#8217;t much sunlight outside since the surface was probably covered in black clouds and debris that the sun simply couldn&#8217;t get through. Before the war, there was sunlight, and these lamps mimicked it. The only way to get regular access to the conservatory was to work here. When she toured it while still deciding which vocation to pursue, she fell in love with the idea of sunlight, and that motivated her decision to work here.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I was wondering if you would actually make it to work today, missy,&#8221; Wanda said with a quick glance up at Juliet from where she was sitting at one of the worktables.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t feeling well,&#8221; Juliet responded. She didn&#8217;t feel like sharing about her emotional morning and being unprepared for the alarm. Saying she was sick didn&#8217;t feel like a total stretch of the truth. Juliet swept a brown lock of straight hair behind her ear before sitting at the bench next to Wanda, a short slim woman with strawberry blond hair styled in a bob. Sitting next to Wanda made Juliet feel like a giant even though Juliet was average height with a slender build.</p>

  <p class="p1">She squinted with concentration as she watched Wanda make wells into the synthetic dirt with her gloved fingers then transfer seeds from a cup of water into the well. Juliet grabbed one of the trays of synthetic dirt from the middle of the table and placed it in front of her, ready to get seeds planted for the currently barren green plot.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Oh, no, missy,&#8221; Wanda said. &#8220;I was going to show you my planting technique this morning, but now I&#8217;ve done more than half of the job.&#8221; She took the tray away from Juliet. &#8220;You&#8217;re on pruning duty. Make sure there are no dead leaves in the yellow plot and then maybe if you still have time before your shift is over, you can help with the last few seeds.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Ugh,&#8221; Juliet groaned. Some of the plant care was already automated and regulated by the computer system including watering, fertilizer, and hours of sun lamps. There were a few others who worked the conservatory and took care of harvesting, planting, plowing, managing the synthetic soil supplies and refreshing the compost. One of them was Jim. He was a year older than Juliet and was tall and muscular from the heavy work he did. His brown hair had never met a comb and existed in a perpetual mess.</p>

  <p class="p1">A few tasks were left out of the scope of heavy duty work, and they were assigned to Juliet. She walked over to the supply shed and pulled a pair of pruning scissors off the wall, then went to the yellow plot, kneeling in front of the first plant.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Hey, Jules,&#8221; Jim called to Juliet. &#8220;You should come over here and help me out. I&#8217;ll let you pick my tomato,&#8221; he said with a smirk. He was with the other workers at the red plot picking ripe tomatoes.</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet scoffed at the obvious flirtation and said, &#8220;You wish, Jim. I&#8217;ll be busy for a while with the pruning.&#8221; She tried to give him a disgusted look but made more of a squinty face from the bright light.</p>

  <p class="p1">The conservatory was a pretty small operation considering the size of Refuge. Although it didn&#8217;t provide all the food for the whole population of just over three hundred, it did offer a little variety to what would otherwise be a boring diet. There was an enormous storage area where among other things all the grains and flour and plenty of canned foods were housed. Juliet heard rumors that they had enough food in Refuge for the next 150 years without the fresh fruits and vegetables that the conservatory provided. She thought it was a little odd that in preparation for wartime, a conservatory and chicken coup were deemed important enough to construct in a bomb shelter. But she was glad they were. Everyone at Refuge enjoyed the fresh food. Fresh tomatoes, fresh eggs, and fresh chicken.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Mmm, juicy tomatoes today,&#8221; Jim said to himself, loudly enough for Juliet to overhear. &#8220;Just makes me wanna take a big bite.&#8221; He looked over at Juliet while holding the fat red fruit up to his face and she looked back at his intense brown eyes. He maintained eye contact with her as he took a big bite out of the tomato flesh, drops of juices spraying and dribbling down his chin. He closed his eyes for a moment as he chewed and let out a satisfied moan, then opened his eyes back up still focused on Juliet. Although she didn&#8217;t quite understand the innuendo, Juliet sensed the sexual context. She didn&#8217;t have romantic feeling for him but could feel her face flush as Jim graphically enjoyed his snack.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Back to work, missy,&#8221; Wanda said, breaking the spell. Juliet realized she had put down her pruning scissors. She was still kneeling next to the first plant gazing at Jim. She grabbed her scissors and started pruning. When she glanced back at Jim, he was already back to picking tomatoes at lightning speed, putting them into the large bag hanging at his hip, still eating the first tomato with his free hand. The moment between them had passed, whatever it was.</p>

  <p class="sb">&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

  <p class="p1">Lauren sat at her desk. She didn&#8217;t feel like working. Deciding to pursue higher education was a lot harder than she originally thought it would be. So much of her time was spent studying. It didn&#8217;t help that during the semester, she saw and interacted with only 150 people.</p>

  <p class="p1">She had romanticized the notion of living in a subterranean shelter, or SS for short. She had never been in one but had read all about it from the messages Juliet sent her. When Boston University opened an extension in an old cold war era bomb shelter, Lauren jumped at the opportunity to enroll there. Even though it seemed like a fabulous idea, in the beginning, eating, sleeping, studying, and attending class with the same people every day for weeks on end was making Lauren feel claustrophobic. She decided that she would write a new message to Juliet before jumping into her studies.</p>

  <p class="p1">Everyone in her third-grade class was assigned a pen pal as a creative writing assignment. <i>Pretend that you live in a shelter and write a paragraph about life underground!</i> After the assignment, Lauren loved reading her new pen pal Juliet&#8217;s responses so much that she kept writing back. She wrote a long message about her family&#8217;s apartment in Boston, going to the beach for their summer vacation, and how much she enjoyed her school. She received this reply:</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Incoming communications to SS14 are reviewed for content. Your communication has been modified to remove the following offensive content: Mention of people living outside of subterranean shelters. Mention of moving out of a subterranean shelter. Descriptions of conditions outside of SS14. Mention of item(s) not found in subterranean shelters. Your communication has been modified to read:</p>

  <p class="p1"></p>

  <p class="p2">Dear Juliet,</p>

  <p class="p2">Hey girl! I had fun reading your message... Write back soon!</p>

  <p class="p2">Yours, Lauren.</p>

  <p class="p1">Young Lauren had been crushed by the fact that the message she sent was censored. It seemed little information transferred between SS14 and the outside world. She learned more about the shelter through Juliet&#8217;s messages than the day dedicated to it in her high school American history class. As they had continued writing messages to each other, Lauren suspected Juliet knew little to nothing about the outside world.</p>

  <p class="p1">Stretching her fingers then placing them on her laptop, Lauren opened her email client and started typing a message:</p>

  <p class="p2">Hey Juliet,</p>

  <p class="p2">I think continuing school was a mistake for me. Maybe you were the smarter one to jump straight into work. How has your first week in the conservatory been? Is your Jim as dreamy as I am imagining him? Because I had a nice dream featuring him the other night. It included him with no shirt, a nice six pack, and a super juicy tomato. Too much?</p>

  <p class="p2">Still, I can&#8217;t believe you didn&#8217;t stick with school just to get a cushy job in your command center. You come across as so intellectual and witty in your messages, so you would certainly have less trouble than humble little me getting through the education part. I know you were scared by that officer when your dad died, but that doesn&#8217;t make becoming an officer a bad choice for you. Plus, you&#8217;ve got that weird tie fetish thing, so you would enjoy it.</p>

  <p class="p2">You know the guy I mentioned from school, Grant? I told him we could totally hang out some time and he has been practically stalking me ever since. He acts like we are in a committed relationship that will lead to marriage, even though we haven&#8217;t even been on a date! I can&#8217;t believe I felt sorry for the guy. This is what I get for trying to do something nice.</p>

  <p class="p2">OK, I&#8217;ve been procrastinating too much. Time for me to study. Later my girl.</p>

  <p class="p2">Yours, Lauren</p>

  <h3>2</h3>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Whatcha reading?&#8221; Derrick asked as he peered through his thick black framed glasses over Juliet&#8217;s shoulder. Juliet shut down her micro tab quickly so he wouldn&#8217;t be able to read what was on the screen.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Juliet replied, &#8220;Just a message from my pen pal.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;You still message your pen pal?&#8221; Derrick asked raising an eyebrow. &#8220;I stopped messaging mine as soon as the assignment was over in second grade.&#8221; He moved to the other side of the table where Juliet sat and took the seat across from her. He was tall and slender with light brown hair. Juliet guessed that he only shaved once a week since his face fluctuated between clean and scruffy. Jim came next with his dinner tray and sat next to Derrick. Cass was already seated next to Juliet.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Third grade,&#8221; Juliet said, correcting Derrick. &#8220;She&#8217;s the one who keeps writing me. I tried to let it go, but every time I check my micro tab, she&#8217;s sent another message.&#8221; Really, their writing relationship was pretty balanced, but Juliet&#8217;s friends already thought she was a bit strange. With such a small group of people her age living in Refuge, she didn&#8217;t want to stand out.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;How is Lauren?&#8221; Cass asked. Juliet&#8217;s best friend was a true beauty with wavy blond hair and blue eyes. In addition to her striking face, Cass wore the uniform for her occupation in personal care. The personal care uniforms were a lot more attractive consisting of a fitted white blouse and skirt which showed off a lot more skin than the long sleeve shirt and overalls dictated by the conservatory which Jim and Juliet wore. Cass&#8217;s nice figure was evident under her uniform, and although Jim&#8217;s musculature was visible through his shirt, Juliet&#8217;s figure was swallowed by her uniform. Maybe Jim was so infatuated with Juliet because someone had told him about her ample breasts because they sure weren&#8217;t visible when she wore her uniform.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;She&#8217;s good. Obsessed with boys as always,&#8221; Juliet said. She kept the details of Lauren&#8217;s dream about Jim to herself. &#8220;She decided to do continued education. I think that&#8217;s the first time she&#8217;s mentioned school since Mrs. Barkley graded our messages.&#8221; Their third-grade teacher had given them an outline of what to include in the messages: one sentence about themselves, one about school, and one about their favorite food. Juliet assumed that Lauren&#8217;s class had the same requirements when writing their messages.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Lauren did continued education,&#8221; Cass said, &#8220;even though she only writes to you about boys? You&#8217;re the one who should have done continued education. I can&#8217;t believe Derrick is the only one of us who decided to do it.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I like the Conservatory,&#8221; Juliet said. Her real reasons for choosing work were a little more complex. She didn&#8217;t want to discuss her aversion from continued education, which would lead to a job in command, with her friends. Shaking her head, she pushed the image of the officer with his tie neatly held down with a tac out of her thoughts.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Really, Jules just wanted to spend her days with me,&#8221; Jim said. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that right? You only like the conservatory because I&#8217;m there.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">They all chuckled at Juliet until she said, &#8220;Stop it.&#8221; The four friends sat quietly for a while eating their dinner of some sort of grain and protein slop paired with a fresh orange, water, and a small container of pills which were mostly vitamins.</p>

  <p class="p1">Derrick finally broke the silence. &#8220;Is no one going to ask about the alarm this morning?&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I thought it was just a drill,&#8221; Cass said, flipping her hair over her shoulder to keep it from dragging in her food as she ate.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure the alarm is only for fire, so if it wasn&#8217;t a drill or malfunction, I&#8217;d bet on fire,&#8221; Jim said.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;It&#8217;s not only for fire,&#8221; Derrick corrected, lifting his black glasses up his face by pushing the corner with his fingertips, &#8220;but, it was a fire.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet jerked her head up, looking straight into Derrick&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;For real? There was an actual fire?&#8221; The color drained from her face, and she felt sick to her stomach.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Yes, an actual fire. I saw it,&#8221; Derrick said proudly. &#8220;It started as an electrical fire in command. I helped put it out.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Is that under your continued education list of duties, fighting fire?&#8221; Cass asked, flipping her hair away from her face.</p>

  <p class="p1">Derrick shook his head. &#8220;No, that usually falls to mechanical maintenance, but those of us in the study room were closer.&#8221; He looked at Juliet and took in her pallor and slumped posture. He reached his hand under the table to give her knee a squeeze before she quickly pulled away. &#8220;Hey Juliet,&#8221; he said in a softer tone. &#8220;No one died or got hurt or anything.&#8221; Juliet stared at her tray of uneaten food as no one said anything.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;m really looking forward to Harvest Homecoming,&#8221; Cass said trying to cut the tension.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Yes, me too,&#8221; Jim said.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;This is the first time we get to do casino night instead of the school dance,&#8221; Cass said indicating Juliet and herself.</p>

  <p class="p1">Jim spoke even though his mouth was full of food. &#8220;I went to casino night last year, and it was pretty freaking amazing. I won around 1,000 credits in a few hands of blackjack.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you <i>lose</i> a lot of credits at casino night?&#8221; Derrick asked. He was in his third year at continued education, making him the oldest of the group at twenty-two.</p>

  <p class="p1">Jim jabbed Derrick with his elbow, &#8220;Man, I got distracted. Rita was looking <i>hot</i> that night.&#8221; Both men chuckled knowingly while Cass and Juliet sighed at each other. Juliet rolled her eyes which elicited a giggle from Cass. Jim had already dated most of the women around their age but now had his sights on Juliet. She did find him attractive, and he was nice enough even if he could be pretty crass.</p>

  <p class="p1">A bell chimed over the PA system in the cafeteria, letting everyone know dinner was ending soon. The residents would need to head out so that the maintenance staff could clean and lock down the room until it opened for breakfast the next morning. The cafeteria wasn&#8217;t big enough for all of Refuge&#8217;s residents to eat at once. Lunch was served in shifts&mdash; first was school children, their teachers, and the few older adults who were no longer able to work, second which included Juliet and her friends consisted of all the working adults and continued education students, and finally the third shift was for the late rising teenagers. Dinner and breakfast were only served once. Families ate in their bunks, so just the unmarried adults ate in the cafeteria for dinner. They would get a few hours of free time before they had to check back into their dorms, and then lights out.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Blackjack practice?&#8221; Derrick asked Jim.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;You bet. Let me go back to my dorm and grab the cards, and I&#8217;ll meet you at the pipe.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the center,&#8221; Juliet said to Cass. She preferred spending time in the area of Refuge that was actually purposed for getting together and spending free time.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Yeah, right behind you, Juliet,&#8221; Cass replied. They deposited their treys at the kitchen window then the four of them left the cafeteria and went their separate ways.</p>

  <p class="sb">&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet learned about the annual growth cycle for trees when she was younger, and although she saw plants every day in the conservatory, she had never seen an entire forest of trees change color in perfect unison, making a patchwork of warm reds, oranges, yellows, and browns. The Harvest Homecoming, a celebration of the changing seasons which were otherwise unapparent in Refuge, was just a week away. Life in Refuge could get pretty mundane, so four large celebrations happened each year to help lift the spirits of all the residents. Harvest Homecoming was a three-day event which combined a few traditional holidays from life before the war that the older residents had celebrated before coming underground. For all three days, the center would be decorated in all the warm colors which represented autumn.</p>

  <p class="p1">The first day of celebrations consisted of spending the entire day cooking and eating with family. Juliet didn&#8217;t have any family left. She was an only child and her mother had gotten ill and passed a year after she lost her father. She spent the rest of her childhood in the care of the Kaufman family, making her friend Cass more like a sister. Cass&#8217;s mother Linda treated Juliet as her own, and although Juliet loved her surrogate family, it just wasn&#8217;t the same.</p>

  <p class="p1">The second day of Harvest Homecoming was for the children. They would dress up in the uniform of whatever vocation they wanted to do, many children changing their mind every year, then would tour all the areas of Refuge that were normally off-limits for children, getting candies from the people working there. Juliet loved this part of Harvest Homecoming as a child, because it was her chance to see command where engineering was located, and she aspired to become an engineer. But after the fire, Juliet would avoid command, afraid of the officer with the tie held down by a tack.</p>

  <p class="p1">Homecoming, as Juliet heard from Cass&#8217;s father Scott, meant going back to your roots and celebrating the football team from your old high school. He argued that this celebration made more sense when people moved away from their hometown as adults instead of living statically in one place their whole lives. Refuge&#8217;s interpretation of Homecoming was just a dance. The teenagers would have a semi-formal dance in the cafeteria, and the center would be transformed into a casino where people could play cards and dice games, win credit, dance, and be merry.</p>

  <p class="p1">For Cass and Juliet, this would be the first year they were able to go to casino night, and they were both pretty excited about trying their hands at the casino games. Cass was particularly excited about what kind of party dresses they would wear. Although it wasn&#8217;t totally necessary to bring a date for casino night, a lot of the residents would pair up for the evening, and most of them had secured their dates already.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Should I go with Jim for Casino night?&#8221; Juliet asked Cass. They were crashing in their dorm together on Juliet&#8217;s bed, enjoying a lazy Saturday morning. Cass&#8217;s bed was still an unmade heap of blankets and far more pillows than one person could use, yet Cass always insisted she needed every single one of them. The two girls shared a dorm consisting of the two beds, two dressers, two desks, and a small closet. The dorms provided just the essentials with the expectation that residents were only in their dorms to sleep.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Oh my goodness, Juliet. Can we talk about anything else? You keep talking and talking about Jim. Just make a decision! Tell him, yes, you would love to be his arm candy for the evening.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Juliet trailed off. She had brought up the topic over and over, and even though she knew Cass was thoroughly sick of it, Juliet couldn&#8217;t help herself. &#8220;I mean, he&#8217;s nice and all. I don&#8217;t know if he actually has feelings for me, or if I&#8217;m just a convenient date since we work together.&#8221; She hugged her pillow tightly to her chest.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Give it a rest,&#8221; Cass sighed. &#8220;I know for a fact that Jim is totally infatuated with you. He told me that he was going to ask you to be his date, and when he talked to me yesterday, he said that he <i>had</i> asked you to be his date and even asked me to put in a good word so that you will be his date. Just say yes to him already. Jim is, for sure, obsessed with you.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to say yes, and then have him dump me a week later.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;He won&#8217;t. But if it does come to that, it&#8217;s his loss anyway. You&#8217;re a catch.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;You&#8217;re the catch, Cass,&#8221; Juliet said, making a scowl, &#8220;he should have asked you.&#8221; She was used to all the men their age fawning over her friend and even thought Cass was the prettier of the two. Sometimes Juliet found herself jealous of Cass&#8217;s beauty and how her looks attracted all the men&#8217;s attention.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;You&#8217;re a catch too,&#8221; Cass said, emphasizing her point by poking Juliet hard in the shoulder with her finger. &#8220;Jim is totally into you and only you. And besides, if he wanted to ask me to be his date, I&#8217;d say no because I&#8217;ve already decided to go with Derrick as friends. Just take Jim, and the four of us can arrive together.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Fine, okay. I&#8217;ll go with Jim,&#8221; Juliet said, tossing her pillow aside. She hoped this was the right decision, even though saying it aloud didn&#8217;t make her feel like it was truly settled.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Well?&#8221; Cass said.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Well, what?&#8221; asked Juliet.</p>

  <p class="p1">Cass gave out an exasperated sigh. &#8220;Grab your micro tab and send Jim a message right now letting him know you&#8217;ll go with him to casino night. Then we can finally stop talking about him.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Can&#8217;t I just wait until I see him at work on Monday and tell him there?&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;No,&#8221; Cass insisted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to change your mind over the weekend or chicken out and not say anything when you do see him. Here, I&#8217;ll write the message for you, and all you have to do is press send.&#8221; Cass hopped off the bed and grabbed Juliet&#8217;s micro tab from her desk. She poked a few times at the screen impatient for the device to turn on, then furiously typed a message before throwing the micro tab onto the bed. It landed right next to Juliet.</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet read the message her friend wrote:</p>

  <p class="p2">Dear Jim,</p>

  <p class="p2">I am so glad you asked me to go with you for casino night, and of course, I would love to be your date. I can&#8217;t imagine spending such a magical evening with anyone but you.</p>

  <p class="p2">XOXOXO Juliet</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet looked up at Cass with a look of shock and horror. &#8220;I can&#8217;t send this message to Jim!&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">Cass stepped back to the bed and yanked Juliet&#8217;s micro tab out of her hands. &#8220;Yes you can,&#8221; she said, as she poked a finger as the screen before dropping it back on the bed. &#8220;There, it&#8217;s done. Now come on, my mom is probably already waiting for us at the boutiques. Let&#8217;s head on over there.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">With a moan, Juliet heaved herself off her bed. &#8220;Okay,&#8221; she resigned, moving her micro tab back to where it belong on her desk. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="sb">&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

  <p class="p1">Linda Kaufman was already waiting for Cass and Juliet outside of the clothing shop, one of the eight stores that made up the boutique. The sole purpose of the boutique, which was modeled after a shopping mall, was to spend credits. Cass&#8217;s work in personal care placed her in the salon of the boutique during the day.</p>

  <p class="p1">The clothing shop was buzzing with excitement as women selected dresses for the upcoming celebration. Juliet easily spotted Linda in the crowd. She was a tall elegant woman with short blond hair and striking green eyes. Cass was filling out to be a beauty just like her mother but hadn&#8217;t yet adapted the graceful way Linda carried herself.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Hi mom!&#8221; Cass shouted.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Hi Linda,&#8221; Juliet said, giving her a brief hug. &#8220;How was work?&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Oh, you know, the usual,&#8221; Linda replied. &#8220;The sweetest little kid came in this morning with a broken arm.&#8221; Linda worked as a nurse in the medical wing. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get to shopping, shall we? Now, I don&#8217;t know if Cass told you, Juliet, but she already has a dress for the Homecoming night. Our only goal for shopping today is to get a suitable dress for you.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; Juliet said. &#8220;Cass showed it to me.&#8221; She couldn&#8217;t believe that the tiny clingy black dress Cass had in their closet had ever been worn by Linda, but it certainly looked great on Cass. The plunging neckline showed off her d&eacute;colletage, and the ribbon-thin straps showcased her toned arms and shoulders. The skirt came down to mid-thigh, so Cass sent the dress to her friend Rita to hem it just a little shorter so she could also show off as much leg as possible. It exposed too much skin for Juliet&#8217;s tastes.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Now, Juliet,&#8221; Linda said walking through the store, brushing her hand against some of the dresses as they walked past. &#8220;I really think green is your color.&#8221; She plucked up a dress in a vibrant emerald green and held it in front of her body. Instantly her eyes sparkled like emeralds, reflecting the color off of the dress.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;No,&#8221; Juliet mused, &#8220;That color would look great on you. I was thinking something black.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Linda conceded, and they walked around the store debating dresses until Linda sent the two young women to the dressing room for Juliet to try some clothes on.</p>

  <p class="p1">Like most young women, Juliet didn&#8217;t enjoy looking at her figure in dress after dress. She preferred not to show much skin and having a larger chest, every dress she tried on showed much more cleavage than she was comfortable with.</p>

  <p class="p1">Finally, after countless dresses, Cass was fed up. &#8220;Juliet, you have to wear something! Here, try this on.&#8221; She grabbed a dress from the growing pile of dresses that Linda kept coming back and adding to. She thrust forward a bright red dress.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I can&#8217;t wear that!&#8221; Juliet exclaimed.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;It&#8217;s... it&#8217;s...&#8221; Juliet stumbled on her words. It looked like the tiny little dress Cass had in their closest, only in a shocking color.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;What?&#8221; Cass pressed. &#8220;It&#8217;s red? Like a tomato? I happen to know on good authority that Jim likes tomatoes. Just try it on.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet could feel her cheeks grow hot and was sure her face became as red as the dress. She snatched it from her friend and stepped back in the dressing room. When she came back out, Linda had just returned to add even more dresses to the huge pile.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Oh, wow, Juliet,&#8221; Linda exclaimed. &#8220;Oh honey, that dress is perfect.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet didn&#8217;t want to admit it, but this might really be the perfect dress. She turned to the side to let Cass and Linda see her from every angle. It did have the same thin ribbon straps on the shoulders as Cass&#8217;s dress, but Juliet didn&#8217;t have bad arms, and the neckline was much nicer than she expected. The whisper-thin fabric draped nicely on top, covering her cleavage. It fluttered down to mid-thigh, showing off her figure underneath without being skin tight. She would have never picked it on her own but liked how she looked wearing it. &#8220;I do like it,&#8221; she finally said.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Well, then it&#8217;s settled,&#8221; Cass said. &#8220;This is the dress you&#8217;ll wear for casino night.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;This is the dress,&#8221; Juliet repeated.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;All right girls,&#8221; Linda said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go purchase this and then go next door for some ice-cream, my treat.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Sounds good,&#8221; Cass said.</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet went back into the dressing room to change, pulling her gray scrubs back on. Most of the people in Refuge wore scrubs as their casual wear since they were provided without charge. Even though they did nothing for her figure, or any figure really, she felt she looked nicer in the everyday wear than she looked in her work overalls. She had never worn anything like this red dress before and hoped by next week she could muster the courage to actually wear it out.</p>

  <p class="p1">She waited in the long line at the front of the clothing boutique to make her purchase. After a while, she started to wonder what the holdup was and tried to peek around the line to see what was going on at the register. Cass and Linda got impatient, and went ahead to the cafe next door, promising to get Juliet a cone of caramel ice-cream while she continued waiting in line.</p>

  <p class="p1">Finally, Juliet reached the register. &#8220;Bold color choice,&#8221; Rita, who was working the register, said. &#8220;Is it for casino night?&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Juliet answered, fetching her card of credit account information from her bag. Refuge didn&#8217;t use physical cash and stores just debited credit from customers&#8217; accounts.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I could embellish it with some beads and sequins for you for an extra fee. Casino night dictates a little bling,&#8221; Rita said, gently stroking the fabric of the dress.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;That&#8217;s alright,&#8221; Juliet said, handing over her card. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s already bold enough.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Okay, if you think so,&#8221; Rita said, tossing the dress in a bag. Instead of scanning Juliet&#8217;s card, she started writing down all of Juliet&#8217;s information on a pad of paper.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just swipe it?&#8221; Juliet asked.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Some of the computer networks are down,&#8221; Rita responded.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Why? What happened?&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;There was a fire in command on Thursday,&#8221; Rita said as she handed Juliet&#8217;s card back. &#8220;I guess it fried some of the computer systems.&#8221; She looked to the side before leaning forward and started whispering, &#8220;My friend Vincent said that we don&#8217;t have the parts to fix it. They&#8217;re going to have to take apart some other computer system to rebuild the credit transaction computer.&#8221; She stood up straight again before adding in a normal voice, &#8220;We&#8217;ll need to do all transactions by hand for a while.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Wow,&#8221; Juliet said. &#8220;Thanks for letting me know.&#8221; She took the bag containing her new dress from Rita&#8217;s outstretched hand and left the boutique. She saw Linda and Cass sitting at a table outside of the cafe and sat down with them, ready to enjoy her caramel ice-cream.</p>

  <p class="sb">&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

  <p class="p1">Yet again, Lauren found herself procrastinating. She had books and notes for her classes open and strewn all over her desk and the floor. From Juliet&#8217;s description, the dorm Lauren lived in while attending SS5U, which the students pronounced as &#8220;sue&#8221; letting the &#8220;S&#8221; linger so that they sprayed spittle everywhere when saying it, was similar to the one Juliet lived in at SS14. Except that, Lauren had far more conveniences in her dorm and she could also leave at any time and go out to actual shopping malls in the fresh air.</p>

  <p class="p1">Even though she was sitting at her desk amongst her educational clutter, Lauren watched the TV mounted at the corner of the room. She had turned it to the most boring broadcast she could find to provide background noise for her studying, but Lauren was having a hard time concentrating on Physics and kept finding herself getting sucked back into the mundane news story.</p>

  <p class="p1">An attractive woman wearing a bright red suit jacket talked in front of the current capital building in Nashville. Lauren wondered if the on-scene reporter&#8217;s jacket was the same color as the dress Juliet described in her last message. From what Juliet said, her new dress was the brightest color imaginable. Lauren figured they didn&#8217;t have saturated colors at SS14 and Juliet was just exaggerating. Every surface in SS5U was painted a muted green or gray color, and she assumed that SS14 had a similar color pallet. Plus, the tomatoes grown under artificial light couldn&#8217;t possibly be as healthy and vibrant as the ones that grew with the benefit of the sun. She had read about a charity that collected items to send to the residents of SS14. The colorfully red dress was probably one of those donated items.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;m here at Capitol Hill,&#8221; the reporter whispered. Lauren turned the volume up so she could hear the current news segment. &#8220;...where Senator Stanley Kane is giving an address on the new bill he is endorsing. We will be having live coverage of the address here on CNN.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">The TV screen cut to the podium in the capital building press room. A confident handsome older man with lots of gray hair walked purposely up to the podium and began speaking. &#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, citizens of the United States of America, I would like to speak to you today about our great nation. We have made considerable strides in the past, and I want us to make even greater strides for our future. For our children&#8217;s future. Let us begin our future today!&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">Lauren wasn&#8217;t a particularly politically charged individual, and she always found politicians&#8217; speeches too vague for her to discern any actual meaning. Senator Kane was always good at getting a crowd riled up and excited, but she wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what kind of policy he supported or any real difference he was making in the big picture. Still, she found it amusing watching Senator Kane talking on TV like he was the president of the United States. Maybe if he made himself sound important, people would believe he was important and therefore continue voting for him term after term.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;What I want for our capital, what everyone in the United States wants for Washington D.C., is for us to return this city to greatness. We, as a nation, defeated our enemies from overseas over 20 years ago. It is time for us to rebuild it.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;We already did rebuild,&#8221; Lauren told the television. It was just 600 plus miles away from the former capital. Otherwise, there wouldn&#8217;t be a nice building for Senator Stanley Kane to give his speeches from. She also wouldn&#8217;t go as far as saying we &#8216;defeated&#8217; the enemy so much as the enemy kind of gave up.</p>

  <p class="p1">&#8220;Let us take our scarred and scorched landscape which has been healing ever since the terrible attack, and make her new. Let us make her beautiful. Let us show the world that the United States of America heals her wounds! We were crippled, but we stand up again and we march forward!&#8221; Senator Kane was practically yelling now, which he needed to do to be heard over the roaring cheers from the crowd.</p>

  <p class="p1">Lauren turned off the TV. She wondered if Senator Kane could actually get the rest of the Senate on board to rebuild the old capital. She wondered if she failed this test tomorrow, could she still pass physics 101. She turned the page in her textbook and uncapped a highlighter.</p>

  <h3>3</h3>

  <p class="p1">It was the middle of the night, and Juliet lay awake in bed. She didn&#8217;t wake with a start but just found herself lying there, staring at the ceiling of her dorm.</p>

  <p class="p1">Did she hear something?</p>

  <p class="p1">She held her breath for a moment to limit any sound she was making herself as she tried to focus on the noises happening around her: Cass&#8217;s shallow breathing as she slept, the hum of electricity in the hall keeping the temperamental fluorescent lights illuminated, the slapping of rubber soles on concrete as someone walked slowly down the hall. It was probably just a worker on the maintenance team returning from the late shift.</p>

  <p class="p1">That! There it was again, that sound.</p>

  <p class="p1">The sound swelled louder. It sounded like a person moaning, but it was too deep to be made from a person. Maybe Juliet was just imagining it.</p>

  <p class="p1">Then she heard another sound, like a slow vibrating. This was even lower than the moaning sound. <i>Click click click click click.</i> The moan came again, closer this time. <i>OOOOOooooOOOoooohh. Bwub Bwub.</i> It didn&#8217;t sound like a painful moan, but almost melodic.</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet stared harder at the ceiling, willing the strange sounds away, afraid that maybe she was going crazy. She was hearing things or imagining them. What else could that moaning be? But then she heard a second voice make a similar moan. This one was much higher pitched, higher than a human voice could reach. The high squeal seemed to be answered by the low voice. <i>Bwub bwub. Ooohhh.</i></p>

  <p class="p1">She was definitely not imagining it. This was unmistakable. There were voices down the hall. She assumed they were coming from the hallway. Juliet rolled onto her side, facing the wall. Which direction was the singing moan coming from? She could hear it clearly now like it was right overhead. Click click click click click click. The two voices high and low vibrated and warbled together.</p>

  <p class="p1">They were coming from directly above her. Juliet rolled quickly onto her back with a start. It was right above her, just beyond the ceiling. <i>Bwub Bwub Bwub.</i> What could possibly be above her that would make these strange noises? Refuge was a subterranean shelter. There weren&#8217;t multiple levels, so the ceiling of her dorm was the top of Refuge. Above the ceiling was just dirt and maybe a layer of rock. Above that was the barren landscape left after the bombing. Was there something on the surface or some activity up there that made singing moaning voices?</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet recalled what she learned in history class in general education. Aggression from North Korea culminated in them bombing the United States capital. The US, however, had been prepared for warfare and constructed several subterranean shelters, Refuge being number 14, ready for evacuation from the surface. That had been 24 years ago. She heard from the other students in her class that the surface was a barren wasteland, the result of the nuclear fallout. Their teacher neither confirmed nor denied this rumor, but did tell them that Refuge didn&#8217;t receive any news from the outside other than the pen pal messages from another shelter, and it certainly wasn&#8217;t safe to leave.</p>

  <p class="p1">Juliet heard the moaning again. <i>OOOoooooOOOOH.</i> It seemed softer now. The voices were getting quieter. They must be getting further away. Juliet kept listening, straining her ears to hear the moaning song as it got quieter and quieter, receding further and further away. She didn&#8217;t really hear them go fully away, because the next thing she knew, she was waking from a deep sleep to the ringing of the alarm from her micro tab.</p>

  <p class="sb">&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

  <p class="p1">For the unlucky continued education students who worked the late shift, the melodic moaning was just the usual background noise of the night. Derrick walked down the main hall when the moaning started this night. The only other sound was the thudding of his steps on the worn concrete floor. Near the end of the main hall, he made a right turn into the poorly lit hallway called the pipe and walked along up the gentle slope with just the handrail as his guide. He was just starting the late shift at 2am, and if there weren&#8217;t any extra boxes in the shipment, he would get back to his dorm with a few hours left to sleep before breakfast. With the extra shifts a couple of nights a month and studying all night a few days a week, Derrick really needed extra sleep.</p>

  <p class="p1">Only the young men training in continued education in order to join the engineering department were expected to cover the night shift. It was sensitive information that there was a night shift. Originally, the engineering department had been known as &lsquo;information security,&#8217; but Captain Gerald Clark was concerned that residents of Refuge would suspect there were secrets kept from public knowledge. Although the engineers mostly dealt with the computer systems that kept Refuge running smoothly, they also kept Refuge&#8217;s secrets.</p>

  <p class="p1">During the night, while the residents were asleep in the bunks and dorms and the hall lights dimmed, some poor soul brought in the supplies from the regular shipments. The true secret that required the covert hours was that Refuge even <i>received</i> anything from the outside world, let alone large shipments of supplies. The details of how the shipment made it just outside the only exterior door were unknown even to Derrick.</p>

  <p class="p1">Derrick&#8217;s specialty was resource management, and he was still learning how much of each supply was required to keep Refuge functioning and how to request resources when they were running low. As far as all the residents knew, Refuge was self-sufficient and excellent at recycling resources. The reality was that there was a lot going on underneath the surface to keep the metaphorical gears running smoothly. The computer systems that were damaged in the fire a few days ago needed unexpected repair, and the parts to fix them had to be requested since they couldn&#8217;t be found or made in the shelter.</p>

  <p class="p1">Rarely, there were shipments which had not been requested by the resource management engineers. When these extra boxes arrived, the contents within were a complete surprise. Frequently, these extras included coffee. Derrick had calculated that they had enough coffee in the storage area to keep the entire population of Refuge buzzing for the next 15 years. Sometimes there were items they couldn&#8217;t use. Command would immediately dispose of potentially harmful wares like cigarettes.</p>

  <p class="p1">The most recent unsolicited shipment had been clothing, and not the usual scrubs and uniforms that the residents always wore, but fancy stylish clothing. Derrick gave them to Rita to put in the clothing boutique, claiming he had found them in storage while doing an inventory of supplies. Rita took credit for the new arrivals and told shoppers that she personally tailored all the new items.</p>

  <p class="p1">Derrick approached the end of the pipe. Even though he was on official work duty, he wore scrubs. There was no reason to get his uniform all sweaty, and no one would see him tonight. Since residents were required to return to their bunks and dorms after lights out, there weren&#8217;t any night owls left who would sneak here and get into trouble. Young people came to the pipe because it was dark, at the edge of Refuge, and they could sneak in a make out session before checking into the family bunks at lights out.</p>

  <p class="p1">It was hard to see anything at the end of the pipe, but Derrick knew the door was there as he reached out and felt for it, grasping the handle to open it and slip through. The next room had an automatic light which flickered on a second after the door was secured shut. The room was really just a ten-foot extension of the pipe and served as a vestibule to the pressure lock. The entrance to the pressure lock was on the wall opposite the door Derrick just came through. It consisted of a large heavy circular door secured within a massive frame. On the left of this odd door was the emergency shut off&mdash; a disk the size of a steering wheel with a knob on it. To the right was a glowing pad, where Derrick quickly punched in a code, then held up his thumb to the screen. It made a shrill &#8220;blip&#8221; as it scanned his thumbprint, then a triple beep &#8220;blip blip blip&#8221; before opening the door. A loud hiss erupted from the entire circumference of the pressure lock entrance as it slowly rolled to the side into the wall.</p>

  <p class="p1">Derrick pushed the flat dolly, the only item in the vestibule, towards the circular door before stepping through to the pressure lock. This area was not an original feature for Refuge. It was similar to a cave. Water dripped from the rocky surface that made up the ceiling, ran down the slightly slanted rock floor, and disappeared into a drain. The two large boxes which stood up to Derrick&#8217;s shoulders were heavy duty, built to withstand crushing force. He was expecting just the two boxes.</p>

  <p class="p1">He turned the circular latch on the first box that was sunken in the top until it made a loud bang as the pressure difference from inside the box equalized. The top lifted off and he started lifting bags of grains out of the box, through the door, and onto the dolly. There were three bags of grains and two pallets of canned foods in the first box. He placed the top back on the box, letting the lid drop with a crash as it latched back shut. These boxes would be retrieved and reused. They probably cost a fortune to make.</p>

  <p class="p1">The oxygen canisters in the other box would be heavy. He would need to make multiple trips to get all of them into the storage room. First, he would take the food items to the storage area and then come back for the rest. After stepping through the pressure lock door, he pressed just one button on the glowing pad. It gave five shrill beeps and then made a sustained hiss as the door rolled back into place. Derrick opened the door back to the pipe and started wheeling the dolly full of food down the hall. He started to whistle a tune as he walked. No one else would be up and about in the middle of the night. Derrick had these empty hallways to himself.</p>

  <p class="p1">Hey Juliet,</p>

  <p class="p1">I can finally relax now that my Physics exam is over with. I probably should have studied Saturday night as well instead of going to the party with Grant since I&#8217;m pretty sure I couldn&#8217;t have gotten higher than a C on that exam. I don&#8217;t know why I picked Physics over Biology for my science credit. I thought Biology would be harder, having to memorize all those Latin names and stuff, but that would be easier than expecting me to do all this shady math.</p>

  <p class="p1">See what I did there? Totally glossed over my Saturday night by talking about school. It went just as bad as I expected. When I told Grant we would hang out, I had more of an academic study group setting in mind. Well, some of the guys on his hall were throwing a dorm party and he asked me to go. This was a sad, sad party. There was barely any food, and most of the guys sat in one dorm and watched cartoons. Cartoons! Grant got in some big debate with some other dude about the best strategy is some game they both play. I was so bored I wanted to die. Grant thought it went well. Idiot.</p>

  <p class="p1">I&#8217;ve got some ideas for you for this casino night coming up. I&#8217;ll send them in my next message.</p>

  <p class="p1">Yours with sugar on top, Lauren</p>

  <p class="p1">Lauren clicked send before closing her laptop and placing it back in her backpack. She was relaxing in the student center reading through a current newspaper. With her Physics exam over with and her English paper ready to turn in, Lauren had some time to chill. The cappuccino she ordered from the coffee stand set cooling off next to the comfy chair she sat in. The student center at SS5U was much grander than the subterranean shelter gathering place it originally was. Large skylights were cut into the vaulted ceiling, casting shapes of light on the modern furnishings bellow. Lauren enjoyed all the perks of higher learning which included current periodicals provided in the student center. Today must have been a slow news day because the front page article of the newspaper folded on the coffee table in front of her was a follow-up to Senator Stanley Kane&#8217;s speech. It read, &#8220;Reviving D.C. Comes at a High Price.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="p1">Lauren read the first page. &#8220;Senator Stanley Kane gave an address at the Nashville Capitol last week where he introduced Senate Resolution 3 of 145th Congress...&#8221; blah blah blah. She flipped ahead to the rest of the article on page four.</p>

  <p class="p1">At this point, the Resolution has strong support in the Senate. However, the cost of rebuilding Washington D.C. could be quite a strain on the taxpayers. In order to help fund the project, Kane proposes cuts in spending in a variety of areas to limit the additional tax that would be needed to complete the objectives of the resolution. Some projects like the sustainment of SS14 would be cut, while others like funding to the failing Beach Beautification Initiative would be severely decreased. Even with all of these budget cuts, the resolution still calls for $800 million in increased taxes.</p>

  <p class="p1">Did she read that right? Lauren glanced over the article again. &#8220;...sustainment of SS14 would be cut...&#8221; That can&#8217;t be right. Was that what congress called the aid given to Juliet&#8217;s SS? Juliet had said SS14 was self-sufficient in all her messages. Lauren had believed it was. It made more sense that SS14 received aid from the federal government since the subterranean shelters were originally set up to house a population of maximum capacity for only a month. She decided to stop reading the newspaper. She would look into it later if she remembered. Sipping the last of her now cool cappuccino, she got up and grabbed her backpack, throwing the newspaper back on the coffee table, before leaving the student center.</p>
